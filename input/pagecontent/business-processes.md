This page describes the business processes.

A business process, or process, is a set of related activities or tasks 
performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area, 
such as registration, counselling, referrals. Workflows are a visual 
representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) 
that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a “story” 
for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication 
and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers.

The Trust Domain for IPS Pilgrimage focuses on key business processes that are
part of providing care for pilgrims during a pilgrimage.

### Overview of key process flows
