This page includes sample reference implementation that can be leveraged to support the implementation of SMART Guidelines for IPS during Pilgrimage. Content here is solely for demonstration purposes only.


### Reference applications

#### Reference implementation by Malaysia on MySejahtera App
MySejahtera is the national public health app of Malaysia, developed and managed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Malaysia. As part of the IPS Pilgrimage initiative, the Ministry of Health (MOH), Malaysia, and Tabung Haji (The Malaysian Hajj Pilgrims Fund Board), have collaborated to enable Malaysian pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia for this yearâ€™s Hajj to carry their health records on the MySejahtera app as a Smart Health Certificate QR on the Global Digital Health Certification Network (GDHCN). In the event of an unexpected medical episode, healthcare professionals in Saudi Arabia can scan the QR code, access the medical history, and treat the patients appropriately.
